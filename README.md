# call_analysis_project

## Description
This is the final project for 4501 Sec 1. We analyzed two issues for zipcode area 10027.

## Top10.ipynb
In a first Jupyter notebook called Top10.ipynb, we analyzed what the top 10 causes of calls to 311 are in our neighborhood, and calculated how many total incidents of each of these 10 types there have been in the year 2020. The top 10 causes of calls in zipcode area 10027 are Noise - Residential, Noise - Street/Sidewalk, HEAT/HOT WATER, Illegal Parking, Non-Emergency Police Matter, Illegal Fireworks, Noise - Vehicle, UNSANITARY CONDITION, PLUMBING and Noise. 

## Parking.ipynb
In the second Jupyter notebook called Parking.ipynb, we analyzed whether illegal parking incidents are a larger fraction of total 311 incidents in our neighborhood than they are in general. The result showed that it is not a larger fraction.
