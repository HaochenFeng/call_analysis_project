# call_analysis_project

## Description
This is the final project for 4501 Sec 1.
In a first Jupyter notebook called Top10.ipynb, we analyzed what the top 10 causes of calls to 311 are in our neighborhood, and calculated how many total incidents of each of these 10 types there have been in the year 2020. 
In the second Jupyter notebook called Parking.ipynb, we analyzed whether illegal parking incidents are a larger fraction of total 311 incidents in our neighborhood than they are in general.
